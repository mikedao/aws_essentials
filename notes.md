What is the Cloud and What is Amazon doing there?

How did Amazon get into Cloud Computing?
  -Amazon.com established for more than a decade.
  -Created an e-commerce platform that drove excellent performance, reliability, quality and security.
  -Thinking developed that others might benefit from Amazon's template.
  -AWS designed as its own business. (The selling of capacity is a myth.)

Understanding Infrastructure as a Service - Amazon Web Services is a grouping of best practice, well designed, IT templates that you can use to build services in the cloud.
  -Implementing Web Services requires common components.
    -Internet connectivity
    -Cabling
    -Power
    -Servers
    -Racks
    -Security
    -Cooling
    -IT Expertise
    -Network Equipment
    -Storage
  -The barrier to entry is high in a properly designed system.
  -Build your own post office - Imagine you have to get a package to Detroit. You could drive the couple days there. Cost of gas, hotels, etc. However, we would use the post office to ship it for $30 because they've got the infrastructure that's doin git anyway.
  -What about the trust factor? - Do you trust the USPS? Redundancy, backups.

Doing it yourself vs AWS
  -Do it yourself
    -Massive up front costs
    -Broad technical expertise always available
    -See it, touch it factor
    -You design, build, support it
    -Scaling in Big Steps
  -AWS
    -No up front cost, pay as you go
    -Technical expertise focused on your applications
    -Limited knowledge of infrastructure location
    -"Shared support" partner relationship with AWS
    -Elastic scaling


    Understanding Elastic Computing and Global Infrastructure
    -Define Elastic Computing
      -Draw capacity graph. Show wasted zones.
      -Elastic computing allows you to scale infrastructure as your needs grow, and descale as the demand goes down.
    -Scale to 5000 servers, and you've got two days to do it. (Case Study, the engineer from Bonobos.)
      -Animoto is a company that lets you make videos and slideshows. They integrated with Facebook in April 2008, in three days they had 750,000 new users. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwDS6MexKEo&spfreload=10) 100 instances to four to five thousand.
    -Regions and availability zones.
      -In AWS, a Region represents a geographical area. (US East, West, West 2, Europe Central, Europe West.) Each region has at least two Availability Zones.(Datacenters) Communication between AZs is "free".
